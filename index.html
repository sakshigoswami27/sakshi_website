        <h2>THE SHIFT FROM THE ROYAL BRITISH ARMY TO INDIAN ARMY</h2>
        <h3>The Indian Army during British rule, also referred to as the British Indian Army, was the main military force of the British Indian Empire until 1947. It was responsible for the defence of both British India and the princely states, which could also have their own armies. As quoted in the Imperial Gazetteer of India, "The British Government has undertaken to protect the dominions of the Native princes from invasion and even from rebellion within: its army is organized for the defence not merely of British India, but of all possessions under the suzerainty of the King-Emperor." The Indian Army was an important part of the forces of the British Empire, in India and abroad, particularly during the First World War and the Second World War.

            The term Indian Army appears to have been first used informally, as a collective description of the Presidency armies, which collectively comprised the Bengal Army, the Madras Army and the Bombay Army, of the Presidencies of British India, particularly after the Indian Rebellion. The first army officially called the Indian Army was raised by the government of India in 1895, existing alongside the three long-established presidency armies. In 1903 the Indian Army absorbed the three armies. The Indian Army should not be confused with the Army of India (1903–1947) which was the Indian Army plus the British Army in India (British units sent to India), which was later split into the Indian Army and the Pakistan Army </h3>
        <h4>Understanding the history of the Indian Army can help you understand the country's military heritage and identity, and the Army role in protecting the nation</h4>
    <h5>The chief responsibilities of the Indian Army include national security and maintaining unity, protecting India from external and internal threats, maintaining peace and security within Indian borders, and also conducting rescue operations during natural calamities and disasters.</h5>

    <h2>WARS AND CONFLICTS IN INDIAN ARMY HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The history of the Independent Indian Army is a tapestry woven with valor, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication. From the moment India gained independence in 1947, its armed forces, particularly the Indian Army, have stood as bulwarks against external aggression, safeguarding the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The battles fought by the Indian Army not only shaped the destiny of the country but also exemplified the indomitable spirit of its soldiers. In this comprehensive article, we delve into the major battles fought by the Independent Indian Army, exploring their historical context, significance, and enduring impact on the nation’s narrative.</p>
    <h2>List of Indian major Army Battles</h2>
    <p>1. Indo-Pak War of 1947-48 (First Kashmir War):

        The very birth of the Independent Indian Army was marked by its first major conflict – the Indo-Pak War of 1947-48, commonly referred to as the First Kashmir War. The Indian Army faced the challenge of defending the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir against Pakistani forces.
        2. Liberation of Goa (Operation Vijay, 1961):
        
        The Liberation of Goa in 1961 is a chapter in Indian military history that showcases the Indian Army’s resolve to protect the nation’s interests and integrate territories into the Indian union.
        3. Indo-Pak War of 1965 (Second Kashmir War):
        
        Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated once again in 1965, leading to the Indo-Pak War of 1965. The Indian Army exhibited remarkable determination in defending the nation against Pakistani aggression. The battle of Longewala, in particular, showcased the valor and strategic acumen of Indian soldiers.
        4. Indo-Pak War of 1971 (Liberation War):
        
        The year 1971 marked a defining moment in Indian military history. The Indo-Pak War of 1971, also known as the Liberation War, led to the creation of Bangladesh. The Indian Army played a crucial role in supporting the Mukti Bahini and eventually defeating Pakistani forces in East Pakistan.
        5. Operation Meghdoot (1984):

        Operation Meghdoot stands as a testament to the Indian Army’s determination and strategic foresight. Launched in 1984, the operation aimed to secure the Siachen Glacier region. The harsh and inhospitable terrain made the operation a formidable challenge. However, the Indian Army’s successful execution of the operation established India’s advantageous position in this critical area, reflecting the soldiers’ unwavering commitment to national security.
        
        6. Kargil Conflict (1999):
        
        The Kargil Conflict of 1999 remains etched in the memory of the Indian nation. Pakistani intruders in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir posed a formidable challenge. The Indian Army swiftly launched Operation Vijay to evict the intruders.
        [8:31 am, 7/9/2024] Sakshi Goswami: 7. Counterinsurgency Operations:
        
        The Indian Army has been actively engaged in counterinsurgency operations to maintain law and order within the nation.
        
        Operation Blue Star (1984): The Indian Army’s intervention in the Golden Temple complex aimed to restore law and order. The operation underscored the complex nature of countering internal threats.
        Kashmir Insurgency (ongoing): The Indian Army’s role in managing militancy and insurgency in the Kashmir Valley reflects its enduring commitment to maintaining internal security.
        8. Peacekeeping Missions:The Independent Indian Army’s legacy extends beyond its borders through its participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
        
        From Africa to the Middle East, Indian soldiers have contributed to global peace and stability, earning recognition for their professionalism and dedication.
        9. Surgical Strikes (2016):
        
        The surgical strikes of 2016 marked a paradigm shift in India’s response to cross-border terrorism. In response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base, the Indian Army launched surgical strikes across the Line of Control. The precision and strategic planning behind these strikes underscored the Indian Army’s commitment to safeguarding national security and its willingness to take decisive action.
        10. Current Challenges and Future Preparedness:
        
        The Indian Army continues to evolve and adapt to meet the challenges of an ever-changing global landscape. With modernization efforts, strategic partnerships, and enhanced capabilities, the Indian Army remains steadfast in safeguarding the nation’s interests. As new threats emerge, including cyber warfare and asymmetric challenges, the Indian Army remains at the forefront of protecting India’s sovereignty and security.</p>
<h2 id="Glorious past">Glorious past</h2>
<p>Sixty five years after Independence it is time to recall the past, assess where the Indian Army stands today and gaze into the future to see how the Army will meet the challenges of the future.

    The Indian Army’s sterling performance in the two World Wars was praised by the Allied field marshals and the enemy alike. Indian Army soldiers won an unprecedented 39 Victoria Crosses in the two Great Wars.
    
    The Indian Army lived up to its reputation as a thoroughly professional and highly trained organisation in the 1948 Indo-Pak conflict, when it decisively defeated Pakistan-sponsored raiders and regulars.
    
    The Hyderabad Police Action in 1949 and Operation Polo to evict the Portuguese from Goa, Daman & Diu, in 1961, were two swiftly implemented operations. The defeat at the hands of the Chinese in 1962 can be attributed to the neglect of the forces and inadequate estimation of the military situation. Nevertheless, stories abound of incredulous courage and bravery on the part of the soldiers, in many cases to the last breath and last round.
    
    A very high degree of generalship came to the fore in the 1965 War with Pakistan. In 1971, the Army covered itself with glory with a lightening campaign, liberation of Bangladesh and taking 93,000 POWs in just 14 days. The Kargil Conflict of 1999 will be remembered for the outstanding deeds of bravery of its young soldiers.
    
    Since the 1971 War, the Army has projected itself as a formidable force capable of thwarting aggressive designs and kept our territorial integrity intact.
    
    In counter-insurgency (CI) operations, the Army has consistently delivered decisive results. Mizoram, Nagaland and Assam stand out as examples of successful operations resulting in negotiated settlements. The J&K insurgency has been kept under control and foreign armies have eagerly sought training in CI techniques from the Indian Army.
    
    In international sports competitions, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and Olympics, servicemen have made an indelible mark. In public service, Ex-servicemen have risen to the highest positions as Governors, chief ministers, bureaucrats and corporate leaders.
    
    The citizens of the country at large have great respect for the army. They consider it as the vestige of honesty. It has remained staunchly apolitical. In times of crises, natural disasters or to restore law and order in any part of the country, the Army has always delivered and earned praise. The Indian army is one of the most admired institutions in Indian public opinion. Discipline and values of army life make its personnel winners in various spheres of life. "The strong arm of the Republic" willfully commands immense respect from the 1.25 billion population of the country.
    
    Amongst the larger armies of the modern world, the Indian Army can claim to occupy a place of pride, thanks to the quality of its professionalism, its training standards, its outstanding performance in all operations in the country and overseas and above all, the unstinting commitment of its officers, men and women.
    
    As far as conventional deterrence goes, in concert with the other two Services, the Army has the punch and resolve to exercise its doctrine and keep the threats at bay.
    
    An indication of the Army’s training standards and experience is the number of countries seeking its assistance to provide training for its officers at various levels. Hundreds of officers have been trained at the NDA, IMA, Defence Services Staff College, Army War College, National Defence College and other institutions. Indian army teams have excelled and won numerous international endurance and proficiency competitions abroad, army instructors have been requisitioned by foreign armies.
    
    Will the strengths of the Indian Army stand it in good stead in the future? What should be reinforced, what should be shed and what should be imbibed to make the Army capable of meeting the challenges of the future? Junior leadership, guts and gumption come into effect after contact with the enemy. In today’s and future wars, actual eyeball-to-eyeball contact and close combat will be preceded by days of stand-off warfare, missiles, cyber attacks, electronic warfare and precision munitions raining down on strategic targets.
    
    The army's warfighting doctrine must be reflected in the acquisition of advanced technology and training to fight short-duration limited conflicts in a nuclear environment. The current doctrine was formulated recently and is considered adequate for the near term to meet challenges to India’s territorial integrity. For overseas operations, the country's policy has been to deploy only under the UN flag or to intervene at the invitation of the host nation. The changing character of war in South Asia points to the complex challenges that India’s armed forces are likely to face even in the first quarter of the present century. The army may find it necessary to meet some of the challenges by operating as part of coalition forces or as an expeditionary force. For such operations, the long-term perspective plans must be implemented in letter and spirit, warranting a change in India's defence budgeting procedures.
    
    The Army lays strong emphasis on attrition warfare, firepower and standard operating procedures, although, after Operation Parakram there has been a gradual shift towards manoeuvre warfare. A balance between both is necessary given the variety of terrain. Manoeuvre warfare requires speed and flexibility of the mind as well. Unfortunately, there are not only acute shortages in manpower, the army also needs to expand in order to man new weapon systems and platforms.
    
    The present arrangements for joint operations may be workable but the way forward can only be genuinely institutionalised joint planning, coordination and leadership. Advanced information technology, sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles and communications systems which are central to network-centric operations, require dedicated satellites, large bandwidth and infusion of funds to develop and integrate.</p>
